1. How do you implement multiple inheritance in java?

--> we can implement multiple inheritance using abstract classes.

2. How do you restrict a member of a class from inheriting to itâ€™s sub classes.?

--> we can restrict from being inherited using "final" keyword.

3. Are constructors and initializers also inherited to sub classes.?

--> we can call constructor of a super call from constructor of subclass but we can't inherit it. Initializers are executed whenever an instance of a class is created can't be inherited.

4. Are static members inherited to sub classes?

--> yes static members can be inherited to sub classes. when member with same signature present in subclass than parent members may be overridden.

5. Can we use a field or a method declared without access modifiers outside the package.?

--> without access modifiers it is considered as a Default so, Default method or a field can be only accessible within a package.

6. Can a top level class be private or protected? 

--> no, top level class cant be private or protected. it can be public, abstract, or final.
